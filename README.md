# Time-Series-Forecasting

This project predicts energy consumption in buildings with time-series hourly meter readings based on usage and observed weather for one year.<br/>
With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest to enable progress in building efficiencies.

We develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.<br />
The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a one-year timeframe.
